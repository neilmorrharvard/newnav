# Diagnostic: What Fixed the Navigation Loading Issue?

## Most Likely Fix: Commit Hash vs Branch Name

The issue was resolved by switching from:
- **Before:** `@staging` (branch name) → jsDelivr cached old version
- **After:** `@8fe205a` (commit hash) → jsDelivr serves exact version

## Why This Fixed It

1. **jsDelivr Branch Caching**: When you use `@staging`, jsDelivr caches the file and may serve an old version for several minutes
2. **Commit Hash = Immediate**: Using a specific commit hash (`@8fe205a`) bypasses branch caching and ensures you get the exact version immediately
3. **Cache-Busting Query**: The `?v=Date.now()` parameter also helps, but commit hash is the primary fix

## Resource Hints Placement: Probably Not the Fix

Resource hints placement (top of `<head>`) is a **performance optimization**, not a bug fix:
- ✅ **Performance benefit**: Can save 50-200ms by starting DNS/connections earlier
- ❌ **Not a bug fix**: The script would load either way, just slightly slower

## How to Verify What Fixed It

### Test 1: Try Branch Name Again (Should Fail)
```javascript
// In console, try loading with branch name:
fetch('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sasktoday/newnav@staging/new_nav.js')
    .then(r => r.text())
    .then(t => {
        console.log('Contains [NAV DEBUG]:', t.includes('[NAV DEBUG]'));
        console.log('Version:', t.match(/window\.navVersion = '([^']+)'/)?.[1]);
    });
```

If this returns an old version, that confirms branch caching was the issue.

### Test 2: Check Current Version
```javascript
// In console after nav loads:
console.log('Nav version:', window.navVersion);
console.log('Expected version:', '2024-12-19-8b1b05e'); // Check what's in new_nav.js
```

### Test 3: Verify Script Source
```javascript
// Check which script actually loaded:
const script = document.querySelector('script[src*="new_nav.js"]');
console.log('Script URL:', script?.src);
console.log('Uses commit hash:', script?.src.includes('@') && !script?.src.includes('@staging'));
```

## What We Know for Sure

1. ✅ **Script was loading** (200 status, 109KB file)
2. ✅ **But it was an old version** (no `[NAV DEBUG]`, old structure)
3. ✅ **Commit hash fixed it** (bypasses jsDelivr branch caching)
4. ✅ **Resource hints are good practice** (but didn't fix the bug)

## Future Prevention

1. **Always use commit hash for staging** (not branch name)
2. **Update commit hash when pushing** (see `STAGING_WORKFLOW_UPDATE_COMMIT_HASH.md`)
3. **Check `window.navVersion`** in console to verify correct version loaded
4. **Look for `[NAV DEBUG]` messages** to confirm latest version

## Diagnostic Checklist

When nav doesn't load, check:

- [ ] Script in Network tab? (should show 200 status)
- [ ] Script contains `[NAV DEBUG]`? (run fetch test above)
- [ ] `window.navVersion` matches latest commit?
- [ ] Using commit hash (not branch name) in loader?
- [ ] Console shows `[NAV LOADER]` messages?
- [ ] Console shows `[NAV DEBUG]` messages?
