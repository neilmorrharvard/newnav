# Verify What Fixed the Navigation Loading Issue

## Most Likely Fix: Commit Hash vs Branch Name

**The fix was switching from branch name to commit hash**, not resource hints placement.

### What Changed

**Before (broken):**
```javascript
const scriptUrl = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sasktoday/newnav@staging/new_nav.js';
```

**After (fixed):**
```javascript
const COMMIT_HASH = '8fe205a';
const scriptUrl = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sasktoday/newnav@' + COMMIT_HASH + '/new_nav.js';
```

### Why This Fixed It

1. **jsDelivr Branch Caching**: When you use `@staging`, jsDelivr caches the file and may serve an old version for several minutes
2. **Commit Hash = Immediate**: Using a specific commit hash bypasses branch caching and ensures you get the exact version immediately
3. **Your test showed**: The script was loading (200 status, 109KB), but it was an **old version** (no `[NAV DEBUG]` messages, old structure)

## Resource Hints Placement: Performance Only

Resource hints placement (top of `<head>`) is a **performance optimization**, not a bug fix:
- ✅ **Performance benefit**: Can save 50-200ms by starting DNS/connections earlier
- ❌ **Not a bug fix**: The script would load either way, just slightly slower

## How to Verify What Fixed It

### Test 1: Check Current Version (Should Work)
```javascript
// In console after nav loads:
console.log('Nav version:', window.navVersion);
console.log('Script contains [NAV DEBUG]:', document.querySelector('script[src*="new_nav.js"]') ? 'Check network tab' : 'No script found');
```

### Test 2: Try Branch Name Again (Should Show Old Version)
```javascript
// In console, try loading with branch name:
fetch('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sasktoday/newnav@staging/new_nav.js')
    .then(r => r.text())
    .then(t => {
        const hasDebug = t.includes('[NAV DEBUG]');
        const version = t.match(/window\.navVersion = '([^']+)'/)?.[1];
        console.log('Branch name version:', version);
        console.log('Contains [NAV DEBUG]:', hasDebug);
        console.log('Is old version:', !hasDebug || version !== window.navVersion);
    });
```

If this shows an old version, that confirms branch caching was the issue.

### Test 3: Verify Script Source
```javascript
// Check which script actually loaded:
const script = document.querySelector('script[src*="new_nav.js"]');
if (script) {
    console.log('Script URL:', script.src);
    console.log('Uses commit hash:', script.src.includes('@') && !script.src.includes('@staging'));
    console.log('Uses branch name:', script.src.includes('@staging'));
} else {
    console.log('No nav script found in DOM');
}
```

## What We Know for Sure

1. ✅ **Script was loading** (200 status, 109KB file)
2. ✅ **But it was an old version** (no `[NAV DEBUG]`, old structure with `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded')`)
3. ✅ **Commit hash fixed it** (bypasses jsDelivr branch caching)
4. ✅ **Resource hints are good practice** (but didn't fix the bug)

## The Evidence

Your test output showed:
- Script length: 109,765 characters ✅
- First 500 chars: `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {` ❌ (old structure)
- Contains [NAV DEBUG]: false ❌ (old version)

The new version should:
- Start with: `// Enhanced debugging for nav loading issues`
- Contain: `[NAV DEBUG]` messages
- Have: `initNavigationScript()` function

## Conclusion

**The fix was using commit hash instead of branch name.** Resource hints placement is a good practice for performance, but it didn't fix the loading issue.
